Generate a Private Key
  openssl genrsa -out server_key.pem 2048

Generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
  openssl req -new -key server_key.pem -out server_csr.pem

Generate the Self-Signed Certificate:
  openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server_csr.pem -signkey server_key.pem -out server_cert.pem


How to Use the Certificate

Place the server_cert.pem and server_key.pem files in a directory accessible 
by your server application

open and set up mininet with X11 forwarding

open xterm h2 for the server 
     h1 for the client 

    IMPORTANT: server and client are hardcoded in this example, 
                so it will not work with other hosts!!!

./server  in h2 
./client  in h1 

the message is hardcoded in the client as "Hellow server"
so it will not work with other messages
